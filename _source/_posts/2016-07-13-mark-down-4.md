| Tables        | Are           | Cool  |

This is some text.[^1]. Other text.[^footnote].

[^1]: Some *crazy* footnote definition.

[^footnote]:
    > Blockquotes can be in a footnote.

        as well as code blocks

    or, naturally, simple paragraphs.

[^other-note]:       no code block here (spaces are stripped away)

[^codeblock-note]:


this is now a code block (8 spaces indentation)


        This is some text not written in HTML but in another language!

        *[another language]: It's called Markdown

        *[HTML]: HyperTextMarkupLanguage
