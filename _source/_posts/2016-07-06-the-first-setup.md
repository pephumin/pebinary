Today we mark another new step to success by successfully developing the `official website`. Although there are still a lot to go, but we are proud to present the first version of our website where the key template is done with a few key pages completed.

<!--more-->

For this website, we still have a lot in your plan so please expect to see a lot more progress throughout the year from now on.

Unlike our [Survey Engine] where we usea combination of [PHP] (programming language) and [MySQL] (database), our `official website` is instead written by using [HTML], [CSS] and [Ruby] (programming language).

[Survey Engine]: http://www.siamsquare.org
[PHP]: http://th1.php.net
[MySQL]: http://www.mysql.com
[HTML]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML
[CSS]: https://www.w3.org/Style/CSS
[Ruby]: https://www.ruby-lang.org/
