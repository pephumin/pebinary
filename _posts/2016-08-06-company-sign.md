We need to have a company signage placed in front of the office location.

This will show to the government people from [The Revenue Department, Ministry of Finance] to realise that we take it seriously. They will come and visit the venue once we start the process of VAT registration.

This means we need someone to build a signage for us very quickly. The signage will basically be the logo of the company plus the full company name.

And after having done some homework, we have concluded that the signage that we want to get will be in a form of `acrylic signage` which will give a more 3D look, and will be much better than the ordinary sticker-based signages.

Below is the picture of the tentative look of our signage (based on our initial in-house graphic design).

***Please be moted that the above signage was developed with help from our best friend, [benjy]. So, we would like to take this opportunity to say `thank you` to her for all supports she has ben provided throughout two decades. Many things would be possible without her support both functionally and emotionally.***

We also have got the suggested dimension for our signage to be 88cm x 22cm. We prefer to have the logo and all letters written in white while the background will be in a darker colour tone.
