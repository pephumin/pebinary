We need to have a company sign placed in front of the venue.

This will show to the government people from [The Revenue Department, Ministry of Finance] to realise that we take it seriously. They will come and visit the venue once we start the process of VAT registration.

This means we need someone to build a sign for us very quickly.

The sign will basically be the logo of the company plus the full company name.
