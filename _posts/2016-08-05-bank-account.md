Now we have a bank account for the company.

It is in fact a combination of current account and saving account - under the same company name.

The bank we chose is as expected which is [Kasikorn Bank], the only bank that we always use.

And we chose the branch that is located in the shopping mall, [Seacon Square]. This means it will allow us to do some transactions, if any at all, **outside** the office hours.
