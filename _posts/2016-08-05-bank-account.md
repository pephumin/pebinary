Now we have a bank account for the company.

It is in fact a combination of current account and saving account - under the same company name.

The bank we chose is as expected which is [Kasikorn Bank], the only bank that we always use.

And we chose the branch that is located in the shopping mall, [Seacon Square]. This means it will allow us to do some transactions, if any at all, **outside** the office hours.

***To be honest, we were quite surprised on how many documents the bank actually required for just opening a new bank account. They asked for a lot of documents upfront, plus a lot of filling and signing included for those documents. We found it was quite painful and not much less than what we experenced with the government sector. We hope moving forward it would not be much of the paperwork needed anymore.***

Below is the detail of our bank information.
