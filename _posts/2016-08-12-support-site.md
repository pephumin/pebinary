We start building a new website which can be considered as a `another website in our family`. It has been decided this new website will be a standalone one plus it will also have a right to own its own domain name.

This new website will be used as the `Support website` which will contain all help documents and instructions on how to use our survey system in details. And this will apply for both clients and menbers.

We have decided to use the domain name of __[http://www.pebinary.net]__. And two main sections will be outlined very clearly which is clients and members respectively.

And the mechanics behind this will be quite similar to our main website where we use a combination of [HTML] {% include 0-base/ext.html %}, [Cascading Style Sheets] {% include 0-base/ext.html %}, [Ruby] {% include 0-base/ext.html %} (programming language), and [Markdown] {% include 0-base/ext.html %}.

To be more specific, the [HTML] {% include 0-base/ext.html %} we use is the most advanced version which is [HTML5] {% include 0-base/ext.html %}, and similarly for the [Cascading Style Sheets] {% include 0-base/ext.html %} where we also use the most updated version of [CSS3] {% include 0-base/ext.html %}.

<table class="table table-striped table-blog">
  <tr>
    <td><img src="{{ "/assets/img/others/html5.svg" | prepend: site.baseurl }}" alt="HTML5"></td>
    <td><img src="{{ "/assets/img/others/css3.svg" | prepend: site.baseurl }}" alt="CSS3"></td>
    <td><img src="{{ "/assets/img/others/ruby.svg" | prepend: site.baseurl }}" alt="Ruby"></td>
    <td><img src="{{ "/assets/img/others/markdown.svg" | prepend: site.baseurl }}" alt="Markdown"></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><small><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/"><strong>HTML5</strong></a> {% include 0-base/ext.html %}</small></td>
    <td><small><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS/"><strong>CSS3</strong></a> {% include 0-base/ext.html %}</small></td>
    <td><small><a href="https://www.ruby-lang.org"><strong>Ruby</strong></a> {% include 0-base/ext.html %}</small></td>
    <td><small><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown"><strong>Markdown</strong></a> {% include 0-base/ext.html %}</small></td>
  </tr>
</table>

The outstanding aspect of this website will be the fact that we contains two languages which users can browse all help documents through both languages very smoothly.

We plan to finish the template within a month from now. And we will then complete this website by filling-in with the relevant contents afterwards. All cotents are planned to be arranged into sections making it easy for users to navigate and find their answers.

Some additional functions are also currently considered which can be listed out below:

- [x] Bilingual (English/Thai) [/]
- [x] Similar or related topics [/]
- [x] Breadcrumb [/]
- [x] Feedback function o users can comment if a topic is helpful (using Yes/No) [/]
- [x] Submit function for new topic (or need more help) [/]


And lastly, the ultimate objective is to use both the layout and the typography that are very easy to read for users. A slightly larger font size (than normal) is currently under our consideration.

#### Updated on 5 September 2016 <span class="label blue">updated</span>

`Support website` has been also completed after a month of building.

At this stage we are very happy on how it turns out to be although the actual contents are still yet to be inserted.

We have decided to stop the process on this at this stage. And we will resume building it again once we have the contents ready to be inserted into its database (which will be needed to get inserted into two languages simultaneously).
