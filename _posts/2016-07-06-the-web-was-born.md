Today we mark another new step to success by successfully developing the `official website`. Although there are still a lot to go, but we are proud to present the first version of our website where the key template is done with a few key pages completed.

For this website, we still have a lot in your plan so please expect to see a lot more progress throughout the year from now on.

Unlike our [Survey Engine] where we use a combination of [PHP] (programming language) and [MySQL] (database), our `official website` is instead written by using a combination of [HTML], [Cascading Style Sheets] and [Ruby] (programming language).

And to be more specific, the [HTML] we use is the most advanced version which is [HTML5], and similarly for the [Cascading Style Sheets] where we also use the most updated version of [CSS3]

From now on, we can expect to see a significant progression on the development of this `official website`.
