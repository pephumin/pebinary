Today we mark another new step to success by successfully developing the `official website`. Although there are still a lot to go, but we are proud to present the first version of our website where the key template is done with a few key pages completed.

For this website, we still have a lot in your plan so please expect to see a lot more progress throughout the year from now on.

Unlike our [Survey Engine] where we use a combination of [PHP] {% include 0-base/ext.html %} (programming language) and [MySQL] {% include 0-base/ext.html %} (database), our `official website` is instead written by using a combination of [HTML] {% include 0-base/ext.html %}, [Cascading Style Sheets] {% include 0-base/ext.html %}, [Ruby] {% include 0-base/ext.html %} (programming language), and [Markdown] {% include 0-base/ext.html %}.

And to be more specific, the [HTML] {% include 0-base/ext.html %} we use is the most advanced version which is [HTML5] {% include 0-base/ext.html %}, and similarly for the [Cascading Style Sheets] {% include 0-base/ext.html %} where we also use the most updated version of [CSS3] {% include 0-base/ext.html %}.

    <td><img src="{{ "/assets/img/others/ruby.svg" | prepend: site.baseurl }}" alt="Ruby"></td>
    <td><img src="{{ "/assets/img/others/markdown.svg" | prepend: site.baseurl }}" alt="Markdown"></td>

    <td><small><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS/"><strong>CSS3</strong></a> {% include 0-base/ext.html %}</small></td>

    <td><small><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown"><strong>Markdown</strong></a> {% include 0-base/ext.html %}</small></td>
