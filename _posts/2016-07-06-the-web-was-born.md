Today we mark another new step to success by successfully developing the `official website`. Although there are still a lot to go, but we are proud to present the first version of our website where the key template is done with a few key pages completed.

For this website, we still have a lot in your plan so please expect to see a lot more progress throughout the year from now on.

Unlike our [Survey Engine] where we use a combination of [PHP] (programming language) and [MySQL] (database), our `official website` is instead written by using a combination of [HTML], [Cascading Style Sheets], [Ruby] (programming language), and [Markdown].

And to be more specific, the [HTML] we use is the most advanced version which is [HTML5], and similarly for the [Cascading Style Sheets] where we also use the most updated version of [CSS3].

    <td align="center"><img src="{{ "/assets/img/others/ruby.svg" | prepend: site.baseurl }}" class="img-thumbnail"></td>
    <td align="center"><img src="{{ "/assets/img/others/markdown.svg" | prepend: site.baseurl }}" class="img-thumbnail"></td>

  <td align="center"><small><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS/"><strong>CSS3</strong></a></small></td>
  <td align="center"><small><a href="https://www.ruby-lang.org"><strong>Ruby</strong></a></small></td>
  <td align="center"><small><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown"><strong>Markdown</strong></a></small></td>

From now on, users can expect to see a significant progression on the web development for this `official website` which will start with the overall theme development (plus all the designs involved) and the relevant contents to be then updated from time to time afterwards.
