In order to ensure we are aligned with Thai government regulation, we have registered with the `VAT certificate` with the [The Revenue Department, Ministry of Finance] {% include 0-base/ext.html %}.

The process has been quite painful because it requires quite a lot of efforts including the workspace arrangement at the venue we registered for the company, plus having the actual company signage placed very clearly in front of the venue around the entrance area.

And there is also a requirement to have staff from [The Revenue Department, Ministry of Finance] {% include 0-base/ext.html %} come and <del>visit</del> inspect our venue, plus conduct some interviews with the company owner on potential usage of VAT in the future.

Since the starting of this process by initialing such request via the online portal of [The Revenue Department, Ministry of Finance] {% include 0-base/ext.html %}, **so far we have managed to complete all the processes without experiencing any problems at all**.

And staff from [The Revenue Department, Ministry of Finance] {% include 0-base/ext.html %}, who came to our venue, told us that we would get the VAT certificate within one month, so we are expecting to get the official completed document by middle of October 2016.

*Apart from that they also told us that we still need to submit the very first accounting paperwork to them within 30 days regardless of having the actual sales or revenues run through the account or not. We will connect with our finance partner on this again.*
