This is an initial setup aiming to serve as a trial for `support portal`, the support section of the website.

The portal itself will act as a mini-site which means it will contain a large number of documents / helps for users to read.

All documents will then be divided into two more levels which are `support for clients` and `support for members (respondents)`.

__To be honest, this is still an experimental for support website.__

This experimental will finally tell whether it will be more suitable to use `posts` or `pages`.
