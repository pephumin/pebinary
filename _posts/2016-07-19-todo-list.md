In order to ensure we do not forget things, a todo list has been added to our blog.

By doing this, we will be able to track the activities on website development nicely.

<!--more-->

+ Clickable top logo in header
+ <del>Showcase template</del>
+ Landing form / Call-to-action
+ <del>Parallax footer</del>
+ <del>Sitemap</del>
+ <del>Adjust `<address>`</del>
+

PS: How sad the markdown code cannot be made a proper todo-list (unlike at [Github] where markdown can be automatically converted to check-box both checked or unchecked).
