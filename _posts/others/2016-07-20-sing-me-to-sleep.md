**Song: Sing Me To Sleep (Original Acoustic)** [^note]



Wait a second, let me catch my breath

Remind me how it feels to hear your voice

Your lips are moving, I can't hear a thing

Living life as if we had a choice



Anywhere, anytime

I would do anything for you

Anything for you

Yesterday got away

Melodies stuck inside your head

A song in every breath
<!--more-->


Sing me to sleep now

Sing me to sleep

Oh just sing me to sleep now

Sing me to sleep



Remember me now, time cannot erase

I can hear your whispers in my mind

I've become what you cannot embrace

Our memory will be my lullaby



Sing me to sleep now

Sing me to sleep

Won't you sing me to sleep now

Sing me to sleep



[^note]: Alan Walker feat. Iselin Solheim
