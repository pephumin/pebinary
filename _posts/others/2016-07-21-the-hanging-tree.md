**The Hanging Tree (Original Acoustic)** [^1]



Are you, are you coming to the tree?

Where they strung up a man they say who murdered three

Strange things did happen here no stranger would it be

If we met at midnight in the hanging tree



Are you, are you coming to the tree?

Where the dead man called out for his love to flee

Strange things did happen here no stranger would it be

If we met at midnight in the hanging tree

Are you, are you coming to the tree?

Where I told you to run so we'd both be free

Strange things did happen here no stranger would it be

If we met at midnight in the hanging tree



Are you, are you coming to the tree?

Wear a necklace of hope side by side with me

Strange things did happen here no stranger would it be

If we met at midnight in the hanging tree



Are you, are you coming to the tree?

Where I told you to run so we'd both be free

Strange things did happen here no stranger would it be

If we met at midnight in the hanging tree



Are you, are you coming to the tree?

Where they strung up a man they say who murdered three

Strange things did happen here no stranger would it be

If we met at midnight in the hanging tree



Are you, are you coming to the tree?

Where the dead man called out for his love to flee

Strange things did happen here no stranger would it be

If we met at midnight in the hanging tree
