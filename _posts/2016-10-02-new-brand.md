Since what we do for a living will be highly involved with our [Survey Engine], we have finally decided to make another progress step by giving it a proper brand name. And without a doubt we match the brand with its domain name which is __[http://www.siamsquare.org]__.

But to make the move one step further, apart from a brand name alone, we also have developed a logo. So, when combining them together it should be more powerful to its branding and hopefully it would be seen as one of the easier medium for consumers to remember and recall in the future.

And below shows how this `new branding introduction` actually looks like in a visual term.

Of course when time goes by, who knows how the logo may become. We may twist it a bit, improve it a bit, etc. But we still believe it will be more or less the same as what we see today.

Therefore welcome SiamSquare to our family!
