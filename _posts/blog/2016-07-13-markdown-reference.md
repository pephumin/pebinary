A reference for some of the useful `Mark-down` examples. These would be a good reference for the usage in our website.

<!--more-->

#### Section one

HTML
: Hypertext Markup Language, a standardized system for tagging text files.

CSS
: Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language

#### Section two

| Tables        | Are           | Cool  |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
| col 3 is      | right-aligned | $1600 |
| col 2 is      | centered      |   $12 |
| zebra stripes | are neat      |    $1 |


This is some text.[^1]. Other text.[^footnote].

#### Section three

this is now a code block [^footnote] (8 spaces indentation [^other-note])

```
This is some text not written in HTML but in another language!

*[another language]: It's called Markdown
*[HTML]: HyperTextMarkupLanguage
```

##### Foot Notes

[^1]: Some *crazy* footnote definition.

[^footnote]:
    > Blockquotes can be in a footnote.

        as well as code blocks

    or, naturally, simple paragraphs.

[^other-note]:       no code block here (spaces are stripped away)
