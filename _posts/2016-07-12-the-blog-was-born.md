Within a week right after the official website has been started, we have marked another step of progress by adding the official `blog` section to our website.

This will be the place where we log all the progress / update that we make to the website.

<!--more-->

The blog can be accessed by its direct URL at [Blog].

And for those who prefer the backend access, we also provide specific access at [Blog RSS] (Really Simple Syndication) in an XML based standard called [atom].

To access the atom syndication, just look for this sign [<i class="pe-rss icon-rss"></i>] which should be seen quite obviously in every page under the blog section.

[Blog]: /blog/
[Blog RSS]: /blog/atom.xml
[atom]: http://atomenabled.org
[<i class="pe-rss icon-rss"></i>]: /blog/atom.xml
