In order to make the website look more appeal to the general public, a carousel has been added.

While it is first developed and installed to the [Front Page], it may be considered to be included in some other pages in the future as well.

Currently this section use picture size 1280x500 pixels.

While we currently use `filter` effect by [CSS3] to make pictures blur, we may consider making all pictures blurred from the original photoshop source for a guarantee of consistency output to all viewers from different type of we browsers.
