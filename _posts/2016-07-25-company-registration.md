Today we start the process of `company registration` which is aimed to be completed within this month (July 2016).

We are fully aware this process highly involves with a government sector which can sometimes be a pain in the neck.

Although the process is mainly done with [Department of Business Development, Ministry of Commerce], we hire a third party to deal with this particular process.

And once the paperwork is done, we will be able to start running the company officially as well as launching this website that we have been developing in the past 2 months.

After being through all the difficulties of company registration including the office address and agreement, we finally have overcome these difficulties and will mark another important move for the business.
