Within a week right after the official website has been started, we have marked another step of progress by adding the official `weblog (as known as blog)` section to our website.

This will be the place where we log all the progress / update that we make to the website.

The blog can be accessed by its direct URL at [Blog].

We have included our [Blog] with a lot of modern technologies such as `reading time`, `category`, `tag`, `customised icon`, `timeago`, `archiver view` and so much more.

We really hope this will give viewers the maximum viewing experience with our [Blog].

However, within the blog section, we still believe there are many aspects we should consider improving. And in order to ensure we will not miss out anything in the future, we have listed them down below. *And similar to the other todo list, please note that some items that have already been developed are marked as completed in the task-lists below.*

- [ ] Bilingual (English/Thai)
- [x] Ability to add "quote" to any specific posts where needed
- [x] Customised icon for each post
- [x] Include [Blog Meta Tag] to make it friendly with search engine
- [x] Blog highlights
- [x] Post classification by category (multiple) and tag (multiple)
- [x] Archive of all posts, and a possibility to view by category or tag
- [x] Add reading time based on number of words in a post
- [x] Ability to separate posts into pages (Pagination)
- [x] Syndication with RSS
- [x] Time calculation to display as "time ago"

And for those who prefer the backend access, we also provide specific access at [Blog RSS] (Really Simple Syndication) in an XML based standard called [atom].

To access the atom syndication, just look for this sign [<i class="pe-rss icon-rss"></i>] which should be seen quite obviously in every page under the blog section.

[Blog]: {{ "/blog/" | prepend: site.baseurl }}
[Blog RSS]: {{ "/blog/atom.xml" | prepend: site.baseurl }}
[Blog Meta Tag]: https://schema.org
[atom]: http://atomenabled.org
[<i class="pe-rss icon-rss"></i>]: {{ "/blog/atom.xml" | prepend: site.baseurl }}
