Within a week right after the official website has been started, we have marked another step of progress by adding the official `weblog (as known as blog)` section to our website.

This will be the place where we log all the progress / update that we make to the website.

The blog can be accessed by its direct URL at [Blog].

We have included our [Blog] with a lot of modern technologies such as `reading time`, `category`, `tag`, `customised icon`, `timeago`, `archiver view` and so much more.

We really hope this will give viewers the maximum viewing experience with our [Blog].

And for those who prefer the backend access, we also provide specific access at [Blog RSS] (Really Simple Syndication) in an XML based standard called [atom].

To access the atom syndication, just look for this sign [<i class="pe-rss icon-rss"></i>] which should be seen quite obviously in every page under the blog section.

[Blog]: {{ "/blog/" | prepend: site.baseurl }}
[Blog RSS]: {{ "/blog/atom.xml" | prepend: site.baseurl }}
[atom]: http://atomenabled.org
[<i class="pe-rss icon-rss"></i>]: {{ "/blog/atom.xml" | prepend: site.baseurl }}
