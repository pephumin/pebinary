Today we mark another big step progress to our company history. We have successfully completed the `company registration` with the [Department of Business Development, Ministry of Commerce].

This process started two days ago (25 July 2016) and it has finally completed today (27 July 2016).

As we have heard a lot about how difficult it could be to deal with government sector, we decided to hire a third party to conduct this particular process for us. And as expected, it involves with a lot of paperwork and signatures.

Although we have done the registration with the [Department of Business Development, Ministry of Commerce], there is still another **important** step in this process to be completed, which is the registration on the Value Added Tax (VAT) with [The Revenue Department, Ministry of Finance].

***But because there are some requirements for VAT registration, the actual process will need to be done once we have all things prepared according to their requirement. We currently estimate this process to be completed within the next 1-2 weeks.***

And below are the electronic copies of the completed paperwork that we have got back from the [Department of Business Development, Ministry of Commerce] regarding to our official `company registration`.
