We have completed the first process of `company registration` with the [Department of Business Development, Ministry of Commerce] so our company is now ready to kick off officially.

The next step is to do another registration which is for the value added tax (VAT).

But because this process requires a lot more preparation and paperwork, it is now planned to get done within the next 1-2 weeks from now.

And below are the electronic copies of the completed paperwork regarding to the company registration.
